# Klipper Config

A repository for tracking the different printer configurations that will be used with klipper and octoprint for an Ender 3 Pro.

## Disclaimer

Use these configurations at your own risk. Misconfiguration could damage your printer. Please understand any settings used in this repository before using them on your own printer. By using this repository, you accept any and all risk associated with printing

## Different Filaments

If there are different configurations needed for different filaments, they will be created in branches prefixed with `filament`

## Start and End Macros

Included are the text that can be used in Cura for the printer settings. They call macros in the printer.cfg that will initiate the print. In order to get OctoLapse to work, the G90 gcode and subsequent home, G28, must be in the .gcode generated by the slicer to begin capturing timelapse. If omitted from the slicer, OctoLapse will spam errors in the UI throughout the entire print
