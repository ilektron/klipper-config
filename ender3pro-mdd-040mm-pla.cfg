# This file contains common pin mappings for the 2018 Creality
# Ender 3. To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for the
# AVR atmega1284p.

# Note, a number of Melzi boards are shipped with a bootloader that
# requires the following command to flash the board:
#  avrdude -p atmega1284p -c arduino -b 57600 -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -U out/klipper.elf.hex
# If the above command does not work and "make flash" does not work
# then one may need to flash a bootloader to the board - see the
# Klipper docs/Bootloaders.md file for more information.

# See the example.cfg file for a description of available parameters.

# BLTouch probe. One may define this section (instead of a probe
# section) to enable a BLTouch probe. (Note! This bltouch module may
# not work correctly with some BLTouch "clones"!) A virtual
# "probe:z_virtual_endstop" pin is also created (see the "probe"
# section above for the details).
[bltouch]
sensor_pin: ^PC4
#   Pin connected to the BLTouch sensor pin. This parameter must be
#   provided.
control_pin: PA4
#   Pin connected to the BLTouch control pin. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#pin_move_time: 0.675
#   The amount of time (in seconds) to wait for the BLTouch pin to
#   move up or down. The default is 0.675 seconds.
#pin_up_reports_not_triggered: True
#   Set if the BLTouch consistently reports the probe in a "not
#   triggered" state after a successful "pin_up" command. This should
#   be True for a genuine BLTouch; some BLTouch clones may require
#   False.  The default is True.
#pin_up_touch_mode_reports_triggered: True
#   Set if the BLTouch consistently reports a "triggered" state after
#   the commands "pin_up" followed by "touch_mode". This should be
#   True for a genuine BLTouch; some BLTouch clones may require
#   False. The default is True.

samples: 2
#   The number of times to probe each point.  The probed z-values
#   will be averaged.  The default is to probe 1 time.

sample_retract_dist: 3.0
#   The distance (in mm) to retract between each sample if
#   sampling more than once.  Default is 2mm.

# Measure the x and y distance between the tip of your nozzle and
# your BLTouch tip
# x : + is to the right and - is to the left
# y : + is toward the back and - is toward the front
x_offset: -43.4 # 43.4mm left of the nozzle
y_offset: -9 # 9mm forward of the nozzle
#z_offset: 0

speed: 5.0
#   See the "probe" section for information on these parameters.

# Mesh Bed Leveling. One may define a [bed_mesh] config section
# to enable move transformations that offset the z axis based
# on a mesh generated from probed points. Note that bed_mesh
# and bed_tilt are incompatible, both cannot be defined.  When
# using a probe to home the z-axis, it is recommended to define
# a [homing_override] section in printer.cfg to home toward the
# center of the print area.
#
#  Visual Examples:
#   rectangular bed, probe_count = 3,3:
#               x---x---x (mesh_max)
#               |
#               x---x---x
#                       |
#   (mesh_min) x---x---x
#
#   round bed, round_probe_count = 5, bed_radius = r:
#                  x (0,r) end
#                /
#              x---x---x
#                        \
#   (-r,0) x---x---x---x---x (r,0)
#            \
#              x---x---x
#                    /
#                  x  (0,-r) start
#

[bed_mesh]
speed: 100
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the
#   calibration. The default is 50.
horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#bed_radius:
#   Defines the radius to probe for round beds.  Note that the radius
#   is relative to the nozzle's origin, if using a probe be sure to
#   account for its offset.  This parameter must be provided for round
#   beds and omitted for rectangular beds.
mesh_min: 20,20
#   Defines the minimum x,y position to probe when for rectangular
#   beds. Note that this refers to the nozzle position, take care that
#   you do not define a point that will move the probe off of the bed.
#   This parameter must be provided for rectangular beds.
mesh_max: 190,210
#   Defines the maximum x,y position to probe when for rectangular
#   beds. Follow the same precautions as listed in min_point. Also note
#   that this does not necessarily define the last point probed, only
#   the maximum coordinate. This parameter must be provided.
probe_count: 5,5
#   For rectangular beds, this is a comma separate pair of integer
#   values (X,Y) defining the number of points to probe along each axis.
#   A single value is also valid, in which case that value will be applied
#   to both axes.  Default is 3,3.
#round_probe_count: 5
#   For round beds, this is integer value defines the maximum number of
#   points to probe along each axis. This value must be an odd number.
#   Default is 5.
#fade_start: 1.0
#   The gcode z position in which to start phasing out z-adjustment
#   when fade is enabled.  Default is 1.0.
#fade_end: 0.0
#   The gcode z position in which phasing out completes.  When set
#   to a value below fade_start, fade is disabled. It should be
#   noted that fade may add unwanted scaling along the z-axis of a
#   print.  If a user wishes to enable fade, a value of 10.0 is
#   recommended. Default is 0.0, which disables fade.
#fade_target:
#   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is set
#   to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in the mesh.
#   Users that wish to converge to the z homing position should set this to 0.
#   Default is the average z value of the mesh.
#split_delta_z: .025
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will
#   trigger a split. Default is .025.
#move_check_distance: 5.0
#   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
#   This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
#   is 5.0.
#mesh_pps: 2,2
#   A comma separated pair of integers (X,Y) defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed
#   point. The user may enter a single value which will be applied
#   to both axes.  Default is 2,2.
#algorithm: lagrange
#   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange"
#   or "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which
#   are forced to use lagrange sampling.  Default is lagrange.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above
#   may be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated.
#   Larger numbers will increase the amount of slope, which
#   results in more curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.

# In octoprint, override the z-home behavior in order to use the bltouch probe
